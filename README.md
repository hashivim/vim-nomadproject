# vim-nomadproject

This plugin adds a `:Nomad` command that runs [nomad](http://nomadproject.io),
with tab completion of subcommands.

This plugin is called "vim-nomadproject" because "nomad" is a very
generic term and I didn't want to squat on it.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/markcornick/vim-nomadproject.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.
